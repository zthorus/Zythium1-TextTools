# Zythium1-TextTools
Tools to display text on screen with the Zythium-1 micro-computer

This repository contains various tools to display texts (ASCII characters) on an
HDMI monitor with the Zythium-1 micro-computer (as implemented on a Kamami Maximator
FPGA board). These tools come as files that can be copy-and-pasted into source and
object files of any software developed for the Zythium-1.

The RAM files contain the character bitmaps to display ASCII characters, using the font
of the Sinclair ZX-Spectrum (these files have no MIF headers and footers and are intented to be
copied into rom.mif, ram_h.mif and ram_l.mif files).

The source file is in ZTH1 assembly language and contains a routine to display
an ASCII character on the screen (the (x,y) position, as well as the foreground
and background colors, can be selected).
